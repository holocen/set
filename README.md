# Set
Memory game for software testers learning consistency heuristic

Remember the matching card game you played as a child? You’d take a deck of cards with images on them and flip them all face down so that you can’t see any of the images. One at a time, try to find a match in the deck; apples and apples, cars and cars. Set is a more challenging version of the matching game that will help testers develop pattern recognition and observation skills.

There are three different shapes in a card deck: squares, circles, and triangles. Each of these shapes can be different colors, or have a different fill (stripes, solid, or blank). To get a match, you need to find three cards where each attribute on the card is either all different or all the same. For example:

    One solid red triangle.
    Two solid yellow triangles.
    Three solid blue triangles.

This makes a set because each card has the same shape and fill, and each card has a different number and color.

New cards are laid out from the deck each time a match is made, or if no match can be found in the set of cards. The person with the most matches at the end of a deck is the winner.

What this game teaches is something called a consistency heuristic. A heuristic is a fancy way to say: “an imperfect method to find problems.” Set teaches us to look for things that follow a pattern; when software fails to follow an implied pattern, it is inconsistent, and there is often a bug.

Imagine a software product that has 7 pages to submit data. Every page has a submit button and a cancel button next to each other, both with rounded corners. You are at the end of a release, and most of the data testing has been done. You navigate through the pages quickly, just to do a final sanity check, and something seems strange but can’t quite figure out the problem. After a few more quick pass throughs, you notice that save and cancel are reversed on the third page. Furthermore, the cancel button has sharp corners instead of rounded corners on page four. If you wanted to have a more systematic look at the look and feel of a page, you could do visual scans from top to bottom or left to right.

Work your way through a Set deck with a group of testers. Winning isn’t the important part. Hold a debrief at the end of the deck. Have each person talk about the strategies they developed for finding matches, such as quick scans, top to bottom, bottom to top, left to right, right to left. Discuss how they changed their strategy over time as they discovered one worked better than others, or one was better at finding certain types of patterns. This type of observation is a skill that can be developed through practice and feedback.
 
 

 I created resources for the game in Photoshop since I haven't found anything similar anywhere on Internet. Intention is to play it with my 4 year old daughter and have fun while sharpening testing skills. If any developer wants to create an application I would encourage it to use images which I provide  for printing.
 I used 6 colors - Three Primary Colors,Three Secondary Colors - Red (#ff6666), Yellow (#ffff33), Blue (#3333ff),Orange(#ffcc33), Green(#00ff00), Violet (#ff00ff)  
 Three basic shapes square, triangle, circle  
 Three types of fill: stripes, solid, blank
